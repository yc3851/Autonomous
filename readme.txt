The world is represented as a 2D array. The UI displays the world by drawing a grid of buttons. When the items move, the array is updated and the text of buttons is also changed to reflect the change.
I design a super class Item to be the parent class of all the Immovable, Movable, Autonomous objects. Then I create three classes Immovable, Movable, Autonomous to extend the class.
When one item is bumped, it will call the item's bumped method and then call other item's bumped method if necessary. This is a chain reaction.
